                While there are plenty of good ideas out there, we limit
                ourselves to civic-tech-related, social impact work. We
                understand this can be a fuzzy distinction, which is why we
                always will have you discuss your problem statement/idea with
                Open Austin leadership before we commit to anything.
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>

                  Be open-source for its entire lifetime.
                </chakra.span>{' '}
                If this is code, “open-source” means freely available on GitHub.
                If the project doesn’t consist of code, this means that the
                progress and deliverable are openly available in some other
                accessible way.

                <chakra.span fontWeight={'bold'}>Be non-partisan.</chakra.span>{' '}
                Because we are a 501(c)3 organization and we have a diverse
                group of members, we cannot take on partisan projects. Projects
                focused on topics like open data and transparency are fair game,
                but projects to support a partisan political effort are not (i.e
                transparency tool for campaign finance is good, a website
                promoting a candidate is a no-go).
